# Chatter App

This is a flutter based modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package which equips this app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

One of the first simple apps I created while on my journey to learn flutter.
